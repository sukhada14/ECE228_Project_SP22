There are 2 .ipynb files in this repo.
1.ML_methods.ipynb
2.DL_Timeseries_methods.ipynb

In 1. ML_methods.ipynb, \

A well documented code for reading the data (crop_type_mapping data in Kenya), cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis, training \
and testing of 5 different ML models is provided.

Step 1:

In 2. DL_Timeseries_methods.ipynb, \
